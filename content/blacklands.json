  "description": "Produced by Kinfolk, Black Lands was an award-winning immersive AR exhibition recognized at the Tribeca Film Festival. The project explored early Black communities in New York history, featuring digital monuments to Sojourner Truth, Manuel de Gerrit de Reus, and Samuel Anderson. Each figure was co-created with nonprofit partners who rooted the stories in authentic community memory. By weaving art, technology, and liberation, Kinfolk ensured these legacies continue to inform and empower the present.",
