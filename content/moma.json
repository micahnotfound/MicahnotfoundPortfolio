  "description": "Created by Kinfolk for MoMA's New York, New Publics (2023), The Monuments Project was a five-part installation reimagining the role of monuments in public space. The work centered on Black and Brown enclaves across New York City, honoring communities who cultivated safety, resistance, and belonging. Figures such as Seneca Village, the Young Lords, Toussaint Louverture, and David Ruggles were brought to life through archival research and contemporary storytelling. Anchored on raw red maple pedestals, the sculptures invited viewers to reconsider which histories are remembered and how they endure.",
