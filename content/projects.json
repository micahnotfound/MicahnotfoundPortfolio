    "description": "The Monuments Project was a five-part installation featured in MoMA's 2023 exhibition New York, New Publics, reimagining the role of monuments in public space. Created by Kinfolk, the work centered on Black and Brown enclaves throughout New York City, honoring the ways these communities cultivated safety, resistance, and belonging. Each piece highlighted a pivotal figure or collective including Seneca Village, the Young Lords, Toussaint Louverture, and David Ruggles, brought to life through a blend of archival research and contemporary storytelling. The sculptures were anchored on raw, untreated red maple pedestals, referencing a tree once native to the region and emphasizing a return to organic, place-based memory. To This Day invited viewers to reconsider which histories are remembered and how they take shape in public space.",
